'''
mathematical functions for complex numbers

This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described
below.

For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: cmath.

The cmath module provides some basic mathematical functions for working with
complex numbers.

Availability: not available on WiPy and ESP8266. Floating point support required
for this module.

# Functions
def cos(z):
	'''Return the cosine of `z`.'''

def exp(z):
	'''Return the exponential of `z`.'''

def log(z):
	'''

def phase(z):
	'''Returns the phase of the number `z`, in the range (-pi, +pi].'''

def polar(z):
	'''Returns, as a tuple, the polar form of `z`.'''

def rect(r, phi):
	'''Returns the complex number with modulus `r` and phase `phi`.'''
